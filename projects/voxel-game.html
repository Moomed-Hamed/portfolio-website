  <h1> Voxel Game : Minecraft Spiritual Successor </h1>

  <main>
    <h2> Section I : Major Improvements </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      It is difficult to come up with improvements to minecraft that couldn't be modded
      in instead. For this project we need substantial changes to the core game design.

      Mining:
      - Any block can contain ores, there are no "iron ore" blocks
      - More steps to refining ores, just smelting is boring

      Crafting:
      - Any block can contain ores, there are no "iron ore" blocks
      - More steps to refining ores, just smelting is boring

      Portals:
      - Nether & End are gone
      - Portals generate unique dungeons that get deleted when you leave
      - You don't constantly have to keep going out further to find new stuff
      - Portals can have tiers based on what you build them out of
      - Some items can only be found in these dungeons
      - Some items that can only be found in certain tier dungeons

      Settlements:
      - No villages, instead you build a settlement (settlement block?)
      - Settlements can expanded & upgraded
      - Settlers can be assigned to jobs

      Chemistry Engine:
      - Fire, Water, Wind, Electricity
      - States of matter interact
      - Arrows shot through torches get lit on fire
      - Machines need certan wattage to work
      - Cellular Automata

      Cellular Automata:
      - Materials interact
      - Simulation Blocks

      Electricity & Power:
      - Games are more fun when they are challengeing
      - Volts & Amps are actually simulated, make people work for their builds
      - Machines need certan wattage to work

      Structural Integrity:
      - Structures are more satisfying when they feel like they have weight
      - Small dense structures > Large empty ones

      Item Throwing:
      - Holding the q button will charge a throw instead of just dropping the item
      - This can allow for a grapple hook of sorts
    </p>

    <h2> Section II : Technical Challenges </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Multiplayer : I don't really know what i'm doing
      Automata : How much can the game actually simulate?
    </p>

    <h2> Section III : Game Logic & Rendering </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Games consist of two main elements: game logic & rendering. The game logic is what simulates the game state, and the renderer displays
      stuff on the screen based on this state. There are other elements like audio and networking(multiplayer), but these are optional. First
      we will draw a triangle on screen to warm up.
