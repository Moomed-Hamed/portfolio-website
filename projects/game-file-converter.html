    <h2> Section I : Animation File Formats </h2>
    <br>
    <hr class='projects-main'>
    <p>
      In order to create a simple animation format that is easy to both understand and load(think Wavefront but for animations), we must understand what
      kind of data we are handling, lets examine the Collada format, since this is the most commonly used format. This file
      format allows for the storage of meshes, textures, bones, keyframes, constraints, and much more. Our format will not attempt to match every
      feature of Collada, we want simplicity and ease of use. Our format should be able to store a mesh, skeleton, keyframes, and optionally
      textures.
      <br><br>
      First, mesh & texture data. The same formatted data from our wavefront loader can be used. The file header
      does need to be updated to reflect the extra information we store. This is pretty straight forward, all we have to do is add joint count and [?].
      <br><br>
      Collada is an XML format for storing mesh and animation data in plain text. Our format will have both text and binary formats. We will use the
      example of the model files once again.
